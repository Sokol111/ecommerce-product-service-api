# Product Messaging API - AsyncAPI Specification
# ============================================================================
# 
# 📌 SCHEMA-FIRST APPROACH:
#    - Avro schemas (/avro/*.avsc) are the SOURCE OF TRUTH
#    - This AsyncAPI file documents channels, operations, and event flows
#    - Payload schemas reference Avro files (no duplication)
#    - To modify event structure, edit Avro schemas only
#
# 🏗️ EVENT STRUCTURE (Metadata + Payload Pattern):
#    Each event has two top-level fields:
#    - metadata: EventMetadata (technical/observability fields)
#    - payload: Business-specific data (e.g., ProductCreatedPayload)
#    
#    Benefits:
#    - Clear separation of concerns (technical vs business data)
#    - Reusable metadata across all events
#    - All data in Avro (not in Kafka headers) for reliability

  version: 1.0.64
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for Product service Kafka events.
    Events are serialized using Avro format and registered in Schema Registry.
    
    📌 **Schema Source of Truth**: Avro schema files in /avro directory
    This AsyncAPI document describes channels, operations, and event flows.
    Detailed payload schemas are defined in Avro files for runtime serialization.
    
    🏗️ **Event Structure**:
    All events follow the metadata + payload pattern:
    ```
    {
      metadata: EventMetadata,  // Technical fields (event_id, trace_id, etc.)
      payload: BusinessData      // Domain-specific data
    }
    ```
    
    This ensures clear separation between observability/routing data and business data.
